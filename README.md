<h3> Single Ton Design Pattern</h3>

Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.
<ol>
  <li>
    Ensure that a class has just a single instance
  </li>
  <li>
    Provide a global access point to that instance.
  </li>
</ol>
